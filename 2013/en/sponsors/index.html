<h3>Looking for Sponsors</h3>
<hr/>


<div class="alert">Finished. Thank you so much.</div>

<p>
    We are currently actively recruiting sponsors for this event.
</p>

<p>
    Sponsors will be able to reach hundreds of Scala developers through pamphlet distribution, posters and sponsor
    sessions. Sponsors' logos will also have pride of place on official event materials.
</p>

<p>
    We are open to any other ideas you may have for sponsorship activities. Please feel free to get in touch.
</p>
