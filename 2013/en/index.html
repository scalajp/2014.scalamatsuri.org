<h3>Goals</h3>
<hr/>
<p>
    Scala Conference in Japan 2013 is the inaugural meeting of the first large-scale Scala conference in
    Japan. Our goals are to bridge the Japanese Scala community with the global Scala community, and to
    promote industry adoption of Scala in Japan.
</p>

<p>
    The first day (March 2) will be technical talks and tool demonstrations to discuss a wide range of
    Scala topics. Several speakers are invited from Typesafe as well. The second day (March 3) will be
    something more relaxed like a hackathon event.
</p>

<a name="eventinfo"></a>

<h3>Event Info</h3>
<hr/>

<p>
    A large-scala technical event for developers, architects, project managers and anybody else with an
    interest in Scala.
</p>

<p>
    We are planning two parallel tracks of sessions, including talks by special guests from Typesafe,
    Inc. There will also be a series of lightning talks.

<p>
We believe that one should never have to choose between productivity and scalability, which has been the case with the traditional approaches to concurrency and distribution. The cause of that has been the wrong tools and the wrong layer of abstraction and Akka is here to change that. Akka is a unified runtime and programming model for scaling both UP (utilizing multi-core processors) and OUT (utilizing the
grid/cloud). With Akka 2 this will be taken to a whole new level with its "Distributed by Design". Akka 2 provides location transparency by abstracting away both these tangents of scalability by turning them into operations and configuration task. This gives Akka runtime the freedom to do adaptive automatic load-balancing, cluster rebalancing, replication and partitioning. Akka is available at <a href="http://akka.io">http://akka.io</a> (under Apache 2 license).

<p>As the focus of modern web applications shifts to be more and more about providing rich user experiences, and hardware evolves not to be faster but to provide more and more CPU cores, many web frameworks have been left behind, unable to meet the demands of a modern web application.</p>

<p>Play Framework is the answer to these new demands, providing first class support for current web standards such as WebSockets and technologies such as LESS, requireJS and CoffeeScript, while providing the power of asynchronous IO and parallel processing using simple and concise syntax on the backend. This presentation will give you a taste of just how simple Play Framework makes modern web
application development, showcasing support for the latest technologies in a development environment that is powerful and productive.</p>

Scala is an expressive language, but can be hard to grasp when coming from imperative languages. The key is understanding what expression is in Scala, and how to adapt code to be more expressive. This talk covers the 'zen' of Scala development, as well as what changes the new features in Scala 2.10 bring. In particular, we cover:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Expression oriented programming and basic functional programming</li>
<li>Simplicity in Design</li>
<li>Enhancing libraries with Implicit classes and value classes</li>
<li>Dynamic types for DSLs</li>
<li>Reflection as a platform to write macros</li>
<li>Macros and Rainbow Explosion Powers</li>
</ul>

There are several frameworks across languages and platforms of Actors, including Erlang, Fantom, Java and Scala. As developers have built systems using these frameworks, patterns of use have begun to emerge that represent "Best Practices" for actor-based systems. In this talk, we will review such patterns, focusing primarily on how to implement them using the Akka framework and Scala.
