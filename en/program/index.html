    S-2 Keynote Address - The Evolution of Scala <small>会場A 10:15-11:15</small>
  </h3>
  <p class="description">Scala is one of the relatively few languages that escaped from an academic research lab into widespread industrial usage. This was not something that was planned 10 years ago, when Scala was first announced. In this talk I'll give an overview of the development of Scala from its beginning to the near future, addressing some questions one might ask when looking back: How did motivations and expectations change? In hindsight, what were the important achievements? What was learned along the way?</p>

    <p class="profile">Martin Odersky is professor of computer science at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland, co-founder of Typesafe, and creator of the Scala language. For most of his career Martin has worked on the fusion of functional and object-oriented programming. He believes the two paradigms are two sides of the same coin, to be unified as much as possible. To support this claim, he has worked on a number of language designs, from Pizza to GJ to Scala. He wrote javac, the compiler used by the majority of today's Java programmers and scalac, the compiler used by the fast-growing Scala community. He authored "Programming in Scala", the best selling book on Scala and pioneered two massive open online courses on functional and reactive programming. Previously, he held positions at IBM Research, Yale University, the University of Karlsruhe and the University of South Australia.</p>

    A-3 Node.js vs Play Framework <small>会場A 14:20-15:00</small>
  </h3>
  <p class="description">Here's the showdown you've been waiting for: Node.js vs Play Framework. Both are popular open source projects that are built for developer productivity, asynchronous I/O, and the real time web. But which one is easier to learn, test, deploy, debug, and scale? Should you pick Javascript or Scala? The Google v8 engine or the JVM? NPM or Ivy? Grunt or SBT? Two frameworks enter, one framework leaves.</p>

  <p class="description">Apache Spark attracts a lot of attention as a faster distributed processing engine than Hadoop MapReduce, written in Scala. I will introduce SparkSQL, one of Apache Spark components, and Catalyst used in SparkSQL.<br/><br/>SparkSQL is a project to execute SQL on Apache Spark, develped by mainly Databricks, Inc. It parses SQL and builds logical execution plan, physical execution plan, and then converts it to RDDs(Resilient Distributed Datasets). The logical execution plan is optimized by rule-based approach. These planning or optimization framework is provided by Catalyst.</p>

  <p class="description">We usually use Java, when we build web application.<br/>We have been improving the efficiency of development in various ways so far, but we want to improve more.<br/>I thought we needed to change our current style (=Java) and decided to engage with Scala for further evolution.<br/><br/>In order to solve problems when we using Scala, I have been developing a code generator for Play Framework and Slick.<br/>It has the following features.<br/><ul><br/><li>Support Play Framework and Slick (generates; Controller, View, Model and Routes)</li><br/><li>Uses Slick Code Generator and follow with its policy</li><br/><li>Import application structure into repository (database)</li><br/><li>Features that are similar to Scaffold on Rails, and has more functionalities</li><br/><li>Corresponds to Typesafe Activator</li><br/></ul><br/><br/>We plan to release this tool as an OSS.</p>

    B-4 Solid and Sustainable Development in Scala <small>会場B 15:05-15:45</small>
  </h3>
  <p class="description">Nowadays, Scala gets attention as a stable platform for asynchronous event-driven architectures or a pragmatic functional programming language. And I think not a few other people expect Scala better, refined and functional style flavored object-oriented programming. Some people may call it 'better Java' or something like that.<br/><br/>I believe that using Scala as a better OOP language can make our development more solid and safer. It's time for us to think about how to maintain and grow existing (and sometimes legacy) Scala applications without troubles sustainably.<br/><br/>In this talk, I'll offer good parts to practice friendly and solid coding style for programmers that are used to object-oriented programming.</p>

    A-5 Building a Unified "Big Data" Pipeline in Apache Spark <small>会場A 15:55-16:35</small>
  </h3>
  <p class="description">As big data becomes a concern for more and more organizations, there is a need for both faster tools to process it and easier-to-use APIs. Apache Spark is a cluster computing engine written in Scala that addresses these needs through (1) in-memory computing primitives that let it run 100x faster than Hadoop and (2) concise, high-level, functional APIs in Scala, Java, and Python.<br/><br/>In this talk, we’ll demo the ability of Spark to unify a range of data processing techniques live by building a machine learning pipeline with 3 stages: ingesting JSON data into a SQL table; training a k-means clustering model; and applying the model to a live stream of tweets. Typically this pipeline might require a separate processing framework for each stage, but we can leverage the versatility of the Spark runtime to combine Shark, MLlib, and Spark Streaming and do all of the data processing in a single, short program. This allows us to reuse code and memory between the components, improving both development time and runtime efficiency.<br/><br/>This talk will be a fully live demo and code walkthrough where we’ll build up the application throughout the session, explain the libraries used at each step, and finally classify raw tweets in real-time.</p>

    A-7 Scarab: SAT-based Constraint Programming System in Scala <small>会場A 18:05-18:45</small>
  </h3>
  <p class="description">Since 2000, remarkable improvements have been made in the efficiency of solvers for propositional satisfiability testing (SAT). Such improvements of SAT solvers have enabled a programmer to develop SAT-based systems for planning, scheduling, and hardware/software verification. However, for a given problem, we usually need to develop a dedicated program that encodes it into SAT.<br/><br/>In this talk, we present Scarab, a SAT-based Constraint Programming System in Scala. The major design principle of Scarab is to provide an expressive, efficient, customizable, and portable workbench for SAT-based system developers. It provides a rich constraint modeling language on Scala and enables a programmer to rapidly specify problems and to experiment with different modelings. Scarab also provides a simple way to realize incremental solving, solution enumeration, native constraints, and dynamic addition and/or removal of constraints.<br/><br/>Scarab is implemented in Scala and consists of Constraint Programming Domain-Specific Language (DSL), SAT encoding module, and interface to the back-end SAT solvers. The current version of Scarab adopts Sat4j as a back-end SAT solver. The combination of Scarab and Sat4j makes it possible to develop portable SAT-based systems that run on any platform supporting Java.<br/><br/>The source code and information of Scarab is available in<br/><br/><a href="http://kix.istc.kobe-u.ac.jp/~soh/scarab/">http://kix.istc.kobe-u.ac.jp/~soh/scarab/</a>.</p>

    B-7 Weaving Dataflows with Silk <small>会場B 18:05-18:45</small>
  </h3>
  <p class="description"><a href="https://github.com/xerial/silk">Silk</a> is a framework for building dataflows in Scala. In Silk users write data processing code with collection operators (e.g., map, filter, reduce, join, etc.). Silk uses Scala Macros to construct a DAG of dataflows, nodes of which are annotated with variable names in the program. By using these variable names as markers in the DAG, Silk can support interruption and resume of dataflows and querying the intermediate data. By separating dataflow descriptions from its computation, Silk enables us to switch executors, called weavers, for in-memory or cluster computing without modifying the code. In this talk, we will show how Silk helps you run data-processing pipelines as you write the code.</p>

<h2>Sunday September 7</h2>

<p>
  On Day 2 we will host Japan's first ever Scala unconference.
  An unconference is a conference in which you, the attendees, make the rules! You decide what you want to discuss/learn about/hack on. We've never done this before so we're not sure exactly how it's going to turn out, but it should be a lot of fun!
  For more details, check out the <a href="/en/unconference/index.html">unconference page</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The unconference will run from 10am to 5pm. (Venue opens at 9am.)
  We will provide breakfast and lunch.
