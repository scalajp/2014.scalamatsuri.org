  <h3>Goals</h3>
  <p>
  Scala is a programming language developed by Martin Odersky and other researchers in 2003. Since then it has steadily grown in popularity, and is now widely used at leading tech companies such as Twitter, LinkedIn and Foursquare. The Scala community is also maturing, and Scala developers across the world are contributing to the language and ecosystem.
  </p>
  <p>
  In Japan, triggered by Twitter's adoption of the language, Scala has started to grow in popularity, and there are currently more than 10 books on Scala by Japanese authors in publication. Last year, feeling that the Japanese developer could do more to contribute to Scala, and that more could be done to showcase Japanese successes with the language, we organized <a href="http://scalaconf.jp/">Scala Conference in Japan 2013</a> with the twin themes of "working with the international Scala community" and "Scala as a real-world language".
  </p>
  <p>
  To our delight, the 200 tickets sold out within a week, and the conference was a great success. Perhaps due to this, Japanese contributions to the Scala community have noticeably increased over the last year.
  </p>
  <p>
  This year we're going back to basics. Our theme is "Enjoy.scala"! We're also changing our name (which was kinda lame) to ScalaMatsuri. (A <i>matsuri</i> is a traditional summer festival in Japan.) We hope you'll join us for a festival dedicated to experimentation, learning, and good old fashioned fun with Scala!

        Martin Odersky is professor of computer science at EPFL in Lausanne,
        Switzerland, co-founder of Typesafe, and creator of the Scala
        language. For most of his career Martin has worked on the fusion of
        functional and object-oriented programming. He believes the two
        paradigms are two sides of the same coin, to be unified as much as
        possible. To support this claim, he has worked on a number of language
        designs, from Pizza to GJ to Scala. He wrote javac, the compiler used
        by the majority of today's Java programmers and scalac, the compiler
        used by the fast-growing Scala community. He authored "Programming in
        Scala", the best selling book on Scala and pioneered two massive open
        online courses on functional and reactive programming. Previously, he
        held positions at IBM Research, Yale University, the University of
        Karlsruhe and the University of South Australia.
